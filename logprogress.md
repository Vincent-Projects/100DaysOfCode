Start of the challenge.
I want to learn and improve my skills with React, Nodejs, Express, SQL and NoSQL, REST API. I want to build complete projects.

I started the burger builder react app from Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's react course. I wanted to build my own burger and realized that i'm struggling with making it responsive. I think that i will go deeper with css and media queries.
