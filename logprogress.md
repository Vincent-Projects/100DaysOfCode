Start of the challenge.
I want to learn and improve my skills with React, Nodejs, Express, SQL and NoSQL, REST API. I want to build complete projects.

I started the burger builder react app from Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's react course. I wanted to build my own burger and realized that i'm struggling with making it responsive. I think that i will go deeper with css and media queries.

Today i decided to build drop-menu with CSS and try to make it responsive.
I learned about collapsing margins and now understand well the impact of margin on elements and nested elements. I also understand better the inline-block.

I built a simple drop down menu. I'm proud of the hover effect on the list items. But I struggle a lot with animation.

I also add a random IA to Connect 4 and search for MinMax but struggle to really understand.

Today i decided to do the weight tracker app project. So i started with the backend, i made the mvp of the backend which include retreiving weights for a certaib month ( to show them in a graph ), add a new weight for today, and see a weight for a given weight id. The next step would be to build the MVP of React app. I need to understand routing with react and train with redux before. I need to fiish the design i draw on a paper. I struggle to be concistant on social media. It is 8:30pm, i continued the burger builder with react from the udemy course. I did a lot of things today, i need to continue with that concistency. I need to finish the udemy course before october, that i can focus on my weight tracker appthen.

I'm not writing log constant but i'm going to improve that. This week i started create a game with a friend. I also started to create my weight tracker website and make the login design. I'm proud of what i've done.

Today i have connected the API to the React app and make the login form working. I also started understanding redux and react router dom. I struggled though, to manage the token into the localstorage. I think i moved too fast between subject, again my curiosity is too high in those moments. I'm then making a pause in weight tracker app project and continue my burger builder with udemy courses and online documentations. I need to master React with Redux and react router dom first and have a deep understanding of what is going on. I also plan to use zettelkasten for a better learning of what i do and also write some articles.

Today i built the  home page for my portfolio. I coded 4 hours without thinking about the time that have passed. I built a responsive mobile first home page with a menu animated and a scroll effect on mobile to show the menu.
