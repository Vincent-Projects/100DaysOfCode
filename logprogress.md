Start of the challenge.
I want to learn and improve my skills with React, Nodejs, Express, SQL and NoSQL, REST API. I want to build complete projects.

I started the burger builder react app from Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's react course. I wanted to build my own burger and realized that i'm struggling with making it responsive. I think that i will go deeper with css and media queries.

Today i decided to build drop-menu with CSS and try to make it responsive.
I learned about collapsing margins and now understand well the impact of margin on elements and nested elements. I also understand better the inline-block.

I built a simple drop down menu. I'm proud of the hover effect on the list items. But I struggle a lot with animation.
