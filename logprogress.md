Start of the challenge.
I want to learn and improve my skills with React, Nodejs, Express, SQL and NoSQL, REST API. I want to build complete projects.

I started the burger builder react app from Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's react course. I wanted to build my own burger and realized that i'm struggling with making it responsive. I think that i will go deeper with css and media queries.

Today i decided to build drop-menu with CSS and try to make it responsive.
I learned about collapsing margins and now understand well the impact of margin on elements and nested elements. I also understand better the inline-block.

I built a simple drop down menu. I'm proud of the hover effect on the list items. But I struggle a lot with animation.

I took 2 days off and enjoy width my family, and today i'm back full of energy.
I made a simple todo app with HTML / CSS / JS. I tried to make animations. And i make a loading bar. The more i code, the more i want to code. I have made a list of litle project i can make, and tomorow i will continue with Nodejs ( i'm more backend ^^ ).

Today i make fun trying things with CSS. I discovered box-reflect, and i build fade animation on hover.
I also add a random IA to Connect 4 and search for MinMax but struggle to really understand.

Today i decided to do the weight tracker app project. So i started with the backend, i made the mvp of the backend which include retreiving weights for a certaib month ( to show them in a graph ), add a new weight for today, and see a weight for a given weight id. The next step would be to build the MVP of React app. I need to understand routing with react and train with redux before. I need to fiish the design i draw on a paper. I struggle to be concistant on social media. It is 8:30pm, i continued the burger builder with react from the udemy course. I did a lot of things today, i need to continue with that concistency. I need to finish the udemy course before october, that i can focus on my weight tracker appthen.

I'm not writing log constant but i'm going to improve that. This week i started create a game with a friend. I also started to create my weight tracker website and make the login design. I'm proud of what i've done.

Today i have connected the API to the React app and make the login form working. I also started understanding redux and react router dom. I struggled though, to manage the token into the localstorage. I think i moved too fast between subject, again my curiosity is too high in those moments. I'm then making a pause in weight tracker app project and continue my burger builder with udemy courses and online documentations. I need to master React with Redux and react router dom first and have a deep understanding of what is going on. I also plan to use zettelkasten for a better learning of what i do and also write some articles.

Today i built the  home page for my portfolio. I coded 4 hours without thinking about the time that have passed. I built a responsive mobile first home page with a menu animated and a scroll effect on mobile to show the menu.

I didn't write log for a while ( 21 days ), but i did many things. I completed my portfolio and it is now online. I learn c++ complete cours from codecademy. I started the weight tracker projects and almost finish the design on figma. I also reworked my notion Dashboard ( which is name The lab ( 2.0 )). Basically i incorporated GTD system with Kanban and now it works just good. I also started a book on administrating a liux system. ( 900 pages ). I'm only at 150 pages but i learn a lot about the history of Linux and UNIX systems. Which was an interesting reading. I also learn about the beggining of open source projects which was apparently totally natural in the past between scientist to share theire work, and i also learn that mostly computer science broke this chain of free sharable work with different licences for software, paid software etc...
I reviews my goals as well which was a mess. I really want to create a blog because, as a reader, i believe that a blog is a powerful way to learn, share knowledge, create a community around a subject. And even if i will bot be the first to do that in this "niche", i will first, and this is honnest, create this blog for a selfish reason because writing on subjects that i'm passionate about will allow me to learn, first about the topic i will write about, but also increase my writing skills in english, which is not my natural language but the language i love, and my french skills, which is my natural one and of course my blog will be avaible in two language. This, tehnologicaly speaking, will allow me to learn on more things which is switch language in a website. I hope from now i will be logging more often even if i don't code in this repo but in others.
ps : i also buil a profile for github using readme ( this is magic ;) ).

Today i coded for 4 hours. I didn't see those hours pass. I wanted to train for my portfolio and i ended up learning web components and build something really great and find a way to wrap custom components together and finally found a way to have a list of "links" and show only one items for each links on the screen. And the item switch if we click on the links.

Today i started to code the design for the blog in my portfolio. I watched video for implementing KeystoneJS but i decided to implement my own CMS. I already know enough about CRUD and already have implemented lot of it through some projects. I need to learn more about security and need to make design responsive.
